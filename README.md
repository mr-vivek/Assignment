# Assignment


Usage:
Mvvm
Databinding
Retrofit
Room
Glide
Viewmodel with Observer pattern Java ( want to change to Android viewmodel class with mutableLivedata/Livedata ( for automatic orientation handling)


Activity has fragment
Fragment has Adapter for recyclerview

Created a base structure for project continuation.

Tried to separate common code in utility.



Known issues:
- Used Observer pattern, should use Mutable Livedata/Livedata for orientation changes handling.

- Not complete MVVM, took care of separation of concern, but have to add Singleton Respository class for DB and Network handling.

- Not used lowest version, as code would be of no use for future enhancement. Latest APIs needed higher version.
